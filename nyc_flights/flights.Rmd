# Ways to charcterize typical delay characteristics of a group of flights


A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

A flight is always 10 minutes late.

A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it's 2 hours late.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

flights <- flights



flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

```
