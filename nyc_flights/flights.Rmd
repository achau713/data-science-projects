# Ways to charcterize typical delay characteristics of a group of flights


A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.

A flight is always 10 minutes late.

A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.

99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it's 2 hours late.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

flights <- flights

# Delays by carrier

flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  summarise(n())

# Delays by originating airport
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  summarise(n())


# Number of flights by carrier to a destination
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier, dest) %>%
  summarise(n())

# Count of Uncancelled flights sorted by destination
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(n())
  

# Cancelled flights by tailnum weighted by distance travelled, without count()
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum, distance) %>% 
  summarise(n()) %>% 
  summarise(n() * sum(distance))

# Cancelled flights by tailnum weighted by distance travelled, using count()
flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)
```


#Number of cancelled flights per day
```{r}

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate proportion of cancelled flights and avergae delay
cancelled_vs_delay <-  flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), # Calcylate mean dep_delay
            prop_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_delay)) / n()) # number of cancelled flights / number of total flights

# plot it
library(ggplot2)

scatter1 <- ggplot(data=cancelled_vs_delay, aes(x=avg_delay, y= prop_cancelled)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=month)) + geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se=TRUE) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = terrain.colors(12)) +
  ggtitle('Proportion of cancelled flights vs Average Departure Delays for flights in 
NYC 2013')
